## Project Description

This site features a Code Quiz.  When the user clicks the start button, the timer begins and the first question appears.  If the user clicks the correct answer, a "Correct!" message pops on the screen.  If the user clicks the incorrect answer, an "Incorrect!" message pops on the screen and 10 seconds is deducted from the timer.  After selecting an answer, the user may click the advance button to proceed to the next question.  

After the questions are completed, a final score is returned showing the final timer value.  The user can save the score onto local storage by entering initials.  When the user clicks "submit," the high scores pages emerges and provides a list of high scores in local storage.  The user may then click to go back to the previous screen or to clear local storage.
